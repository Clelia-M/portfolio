## Scope of the project
To build a portfolio website in order to showcase my projects as Front-End Developer.

## Structure of the page
**Structure of the page**:
- It presents my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
- When the links in the navigation are clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding sections
- My projects are divided in Main projects and Minor projects and they all have titled images
- My main projects are larger in size than the others
- Clicking on the images of the application the user is taken to the deployed application in Github
- The website was built mobile-first but if visited on desktop it adapts to the viewport thanks to the use of media queries. 

## Workflow:
1. Design fo the website
2. Navigation bar + Intro
3. Projects sections
4. Contact me and Footer
5. Media queries for desktop

## Final result
